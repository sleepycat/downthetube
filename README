Many libraries have been written to pull things off Youtube. This is one of them.

Installation

The usual: gem install downthetube

then put it in your Gemfile if you are doing Rails stuff with it:

gem 'downthetube'

Usage:

In irb you need to do the requires:
require 'rubygems'
require 'downthetube'

And then play. I've tried to make it do what you would expect:

  Youtube::Playlist.new("76E01802262A6694")
  playlists = Youtube.playlists_for "stephensam"
  playlists.first.title # "Capoeira Angola"
  vids = playlists.first.videos 2
  vid = vids.last
  vid.title # "Mestre Jogo De Dentro e Mestra Tisza,Ilheus 2008"
  vid.description # "Roda de fim de ano na praca de Ilheus 2008,gravado por CM Denis."
  vid.url # "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I_4JgV-y8s"
  vid.thumbnail(:large) # "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4I_4JgV-y8s/hqdefault.jpg"
